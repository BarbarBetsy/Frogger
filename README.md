# Frogger
## What it is
This is a Classic Arcade Game Clone and my 3rd project for the Udacity front-end nanodegree. 

## Dependencies
None.

## How to play
- get the little cat girl to the water
- do not run into the busy bugs
- collect hearts to gain lifes (up to 5)
- collect gems to slow down the bugs
- collect keys to release some more bugs (or don't)

## How it was build
Engine.js, resources.js and some first lines of code in app.js were provided by Udacity. The rest was carefully crafted by me using only plain JS.

The game counts your rounds (how often you reached the water).

You start with 3 lifes. Every time you hit a bug you lose one life. Every time you collect a heart you gain a life.

There is no end to this game. But a reminder that the real live awaits outside if you play enough rounds.

### have fun
